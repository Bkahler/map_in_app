This is a map of the UK in a Rails app.

It's main purpose in life is to show that the map generated by following this tutorial created by Mike Bostock:

Can be seated in a Rails app so that it will render correctly. d3 maps need to be served up from a server, even locally, in order to render correctly. Trying to open a map in a browser will throw an exception. 

d3 maps rely on GeoJSON files to render their paths. These files, generated by ogr2ogr, are currently living in the public file. There is also the option of setting up the asset pipeline so you can put them in the assets folder. I don't see any discernable benefit to going through this extra step, though.
