This is a map of the UK in a Rails app.

It's main purpose in life is to show that the map generated by following this tutorial created by Mike Bostock:

http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/

can be seated in a Rails app. d3 maps need to be viewed from a server, even locally, in order to render correctly (i.e. rather than having a file path to the index.html file, it should look like localhost:3000/index.html). Trying to open a map directly in a browser will throw an exception. 

d3 maps rely on GeoJSON files to render their paths. Accessing these asset files in Rails can be tricky. These UK GeoJSON files, generated by ogr2ogr, are currently living in the public directory. 

There is also the option of setting up the asset pipeline so they could live in a directory next to images. I don't see any discernable benefit to going through this extra step, though.
